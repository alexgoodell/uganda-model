<h2 id="education-of-anesthetists-in-uganda">Education of anesthetists in Uganda</h2>
<h3 id="secondary-school-and-ordinary-diploma-programs">Secondary school and ordinary diploma programs</h3>
<p>After primary school, students in Uganda continue to a four-year program of lower secondary school, after which they take their first set of exams for the Ugandan Certificate of Education (UCE), also known as the “O-level&quot; exams. From here, they have the option of ending their secondary education and beginning career-focused training through certificate programs. <span class="citation" data-cites="UNFPA2009">(United Nations Fund for Population Activities, 2009)</span> In nursing, individuals can join certificate programs in nursing, midwifery, or comprehensive nursing (which combines portions of midwifery with traditional nursing). These programs are 2.5 years and serve to build the minimum standards required for a community nurse at a health center. After completing one of such programs, individuals are referred to as “enrolled nurses.&quot; <span class="citation" data-cites="Klopper2012-pp">(Klopper &amp; Uys, 2012)</span> Alternatively, there is a 2-year certificate-level program in anesthesia at the Mbale School of Clinical Officers, after which one could join the workforce as an anesthetic assistant (AA).</p>
<p>Those individuals continuing to upper secondary school are able to sit for the Uganda Advanced Certificate of Education, or the &quot;A-level&quot; exams. Depending on the results, individuals may qualify to enter 3-year diploma programs in nursing or midwifery (to attain the title of “registered nurse/midwife&quot; or “general nurse/midwife&quot;). <span class="citation" data-cites="Klopper2012-pp">(Klopper &amp; Uys, 2012)</span> Alternatively, individuals can train as “Clinical Officers.&quot; These individuals are integral to the functioning of district and regional hospitals, where their responsibilities include the assessment and treatment of patients. They can also perform minor procedures and assist in more complicated surgeries. This title is acquired through a 3-year diploma program in “Clinical Medicine and Community Health.&quot; <span class="citation" data-cites="Banerjee2005Mar">(Banerjee, Faiz, Rennie, Balyejjusa, &amp; Walsh, 2005)</span></p>
<p>All of the diploma-granting programs are also generally open to individuals who have completed certificate programs in relevant fields and who have spent multiple years in practice, and can enter without taking the A-level exams. This scheme is called “extension&quot; or “mature entry.&quot;</p>
<h3 id="anesthesia-officers">Anesthesia Officers</h3>
<p>Diploma-level training in anesthesia is available through an “ordinary diploma&quot; (leading to the designation of “anesthetic assistant&quot;) or an “advanced diploma,&quot; (also know as a “post basic diploma&quot;) which requires a previous diploma. An advanced diploma confers a designation of &quot;anesthesia officer.&quot;<a href="#fn1" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a> <span class="citation" data-cites="dsco2012">(DISTRICT SERVICE COMMISSIONS OF UGANDA, 2012)</span> Little is published concerning the structure of these training programs.</p>
<p>As of March 2018, diploma level training is available at seven programs: Uganda Allied Health Institute and Management Sciences-Mulago (formerly Paramedical Training schools), Mbale School of Clinical Officers, Fort Portal School of Clinical Officers, Lacor School of Anesthesia, Gulu School of Clinical Officers, Ishaka Adventists Anaesthetic Officer Training School, Kitovu Catholic Anaesthetic Officer Training School. <span class="citation" data-cites="mohscholar2017">(Ministry of Health, 2017)</span> Uganda Allied Health Institute and Management Sciences is the largest training program and has trained the vast majority of registered AOs in the nation. It offers a 2-year advanced program. <span class="citation" data-cites="mugalopara2013">(Uganda Allied Health Institute and Management Sciences Mugalo, 2018)</span> Lacor offers a 2-year Advanced Diploma in Anesthesia. It trains about 25 students a year and is associated with the Uganda Allied Health Institute and Management Sciences. <span class="citation" data-cites="lacoranes2018">(Lacor School of Anesthesia, 2018)</span> Gulu offers a 2-year Advanced Diploma in Anesthesia. There is little-to-no published information about the programs at Mbale, Fort Portal, Ishaka Adventist or Kitovu Catholic.</p>
<p>Registration of all allied health professionals, including anesthetic officers, is managed by the Allied Health Professional Council (AHPC). As of 2016, only two anesthesia training programs were recognized by the council: UIAHMS and the Gulu School of Clinical Officers.</p>
<p>An national exam is administered for graduates of the advanced diploma in anesthesia. The exam is administered by the Uganda Allied Health Examinations Board (UAHEB), which currently only recognized three AO training programs: Uganda Allied Health Institute and Management Sciences, Mbale School of Clinical Officers, and the Fort Portal School of Clinical Officers <span class="citation" data-cites="examboardschools">(Uganda Allied Health Examinations Board, 2018)</span> In 2014 and 2015, there was a 90% (n=26) and 100.00% (n=17) pass rate for anesthesia boards, respectively. <span class="citation" data-cites="examboard2015">(Uganda Allied Health Examinations Board, 2015)</span></p>
<p>Depending on the results of A-level exams (generally, two principal passes), a secondary school graduate may qualify for entrance into degree-granting bachelor’s programs in nursing, medicine, or a newly-formed Bachelor of Anesthesia. Alternatively, individuals may enter bachelor-level programs with poorer performance on the A-level exams (ie, one principle pass) if they already hold a diploma in a relevant field. This is referred to as a “diploma entry&quot; scheme. <span class="citation" data-cites="mak2018">(Makarere University, n.d.)</span></p>
<p>A new four-year training program developed at Butesema University offers a Bachelor of Science in Anesthesia (BScA). Admission to this program requires either university-qualifying performance on A-level exams or a previous diploma in nursing, midwifery, or anesthesia. Students will complete two years of basic science education with their physician (MBChB) counterparts, then complete two years of anesthesia, critical care, and pain management training. After completion of their BScA, they will have the option to join the third-year of the MBChB program after required service. <span class="citation" data-cites="aau2018">(Association of Anesthesiologist of Uganda, 2018)</span></p>
<h3 id="physician-anesthetists">Physician Anesthetists</h3>
<p>Physicians hold the degree of MBChB after completion of a 5-year training program. Admission to MBChB programs, similarly to other bachelor-degree programs, can be obtained directly after secondary school, or alternatively, through a diploma entry scheme.<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> After the MBChB is granted, physicians join a one-year internship (comprised of mixed medical and surgical training) at an internship-approved hospital. <span class="citation" data-cites="must2014">(Mbarara University of Science and Technology, n.d.)</span> Specialty training in anesthesia is obtained through a Master of Medicine in Anesthesia degree, a two-year program which requires completion of an internship year and two years of physician experience. There are two such programs: Mulago Hospital Kampala (associated with Makerere univerity) and Mbarara University Hospital of the Mbarara University of Science and Technology.</p>
<h2 id="facilities">Facilities</h2>
<p>Uganda is divided into administrative units as follows (descending population): Districts, Counties, Consitituencies, Sub-Counties, Parishes and Villages. There are 122 districts, 255 counties, 296 constituencies, 1460 sub-Counties, and 7467 parishes.</p>
<p>Health facilities are divided into hospitals and health centers. Health centers are divided into four designations, Health Center I through Health Center IV. <span class="citation" data-cites="UBS2017">(Ugandan Bureau of Statistics, 2017)</span></p>
<p>There are two national hospitals (Mulago and Butabika Psychiatriac Hospital), four regional referral hospitals, and 139 district, or general, hospitals. Of these, 65 are government owned, 63 are owned by non-profits and 27 are private for-profits. <span class="citation" data-cites="MOH-hosp-list">(Ministry of Health, 2018)</span> In total, in 2015/16, there were 2,932 government-run health facilities, 983 NGO-run, and 1202 privately-operated facilities. Health center II’s are simple outpatient treatment centers which should be staffed by an enrolled nurse, working with a midwife, two nursing assistants and a health assistant. By law, each parish should have at least one functioning health center II. Health center III’s are managed by a clinical officer and should include an operating theatre for minor surgeries and cesarean section. Health center IV’s should have a physician on staff, separate wards for men, women, and children, as well as a operating theatre for emergency surgery. District hospitals (also known as “general hospitals&quot;) include all the services of Health Center IVs, as well as blood transfusions. Regional referral hospitals include additional specialized services such as radiology, pathology, and surgical sub specialties. Finally, the national referral hospitals offer comprehensive specialist services. <span class="citation" data-cites="UBS2017">(Ugandan Bureau of Statistics, 2017)</span></p>
<p>According to a survey completed by the MOH and WHO found that 64%, 58%, and 28% of regional referral hospitals, district hospitals, and health center IV’s have an anesthesia provider available for 24-hour emergency. <span class="citation" data-cites="hcsurvey2014">(African Development Bank, 2014)</span></p>
