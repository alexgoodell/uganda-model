@article{Linden2012-sw,
	Abstract = {BACKGROUND: There are large disparities in access to surgical
services due to a multitude of factors, including insufficient
health human resources, infrastructure, medicines, equipment,
financing, logistics, and information reporting. This study aimed
to assess these important factors in Uganda's government
hospitals as part of a larger study examining surgical and
anesthesia capacity in low-income countries in Africa. METHODS: A
standardized survey tool was administered via interviews with
Ministry of Health officials and key health practitioners at 14
public government hospitals throughout the country. Descriptive
statistics were used to analyze the data. RESULTS: There were a
total of 107 general surgeons, 97 specialty surgeons, 124
obstetricians/gynecologists (OB/GYNs), and 17 anesthesiologists
in Uganda, for a rate of one surgeon per 100,000 people. There
was 0.2 major operating theater per 100,000 people. Altogether,
53{\%} of all operations were general surgery cases, and 44{\%} were
OB/GYN cases. In all, 73{\%} of all operations were performed on an
emergency basis. All hospitals reported unreliable supplies of
water and electricity. Essential equipment was missing across all
hospitals, with no pulse oximeters found at any facilities. A
uniform reporting mechanism for outcomes did not exist.
CONCLUSIONS: There is a lack of vital human resources and
infrastructure to provide adequate, safe surgery at many of the
government hospitals in Uganda. A large number of surgical
procedures are undertaken despite these austere conditions. Many
areas that need policy development and international
collaboration are evident. Surgical services need to become a
greater priority in health care provision in Uganda as they could
promise a significant reduction in morbidity and mortality.},
