# Data Sources for Uganda Anesthesia Provider Model

Overall, this model aims to chart the path of training and employement of physician and non-physician anesthetists in Uganda from ~1990 to 2045. In additon, we would like to estimate the costs and effects of various interventions aimed at increasing the number of practicing anesthetists.  In order to do so, we need various pieces of data to inform the model. These can be broadly divided into: 
- __training__
- __distribution__
- __intervention-specific__

The major data sources available to us primarily help us understand the __distribution__ of currently practicing physician and non-physician anesthesists. These sources may provide some circumstantial understanding of the __training__ volume. However, there are no current sources to help us understand any intervention-specific data.
