What happens when there isn't an anesthesiologist? 
"It was reported that anesthesia was occasionally or solely administered by the surgeon performing the surgery or an uncertiﬁed nurse/theater assistant."

# Current situation

## General facts
In 2006 there were only two physicians in anaesthesia training in Uganda. 
https://paperpile.com/app/p/d3cdb184-c41c-0112-b2ee-74cfe173d866





Generally, there was a severe shortage of the anaesthetic drugs. Of the 10 anaesthetic drugs that
were enquired about during the census, only 2% of the hospitals/HC IVs had all of them and 19% had
at least half of the medicines (Figure 111).

## Anecdotal evidence

inability to monitor EtC02
erratic power to vital signs monitor
inability to mix oxygen with air on anesthesia machine
no secondary oxygen source
non-functioning BP cuff
inadequate EKG reading
inability to monitor temperature intra-operatively
ventilator continuously alarming ‘low 02 pressure’ in spite of our trouble-shooting

#### History



1890
First Anaesthetic in Uganda
Robert William Felkins, a missionary, visited Uganda in 1878 and wrote an elaborate account ("Notes on labour in central Africa") of a cesarean section done under the intoxication of alcohol from banana wine.
1970
MakCHS Anaesthesia Department Opens
Makerere University College of Health Sciences (MUCHS) started in 1924, and the anesthesia department at MUCHS opened in 1970. Dr. Kityo who trained in the United Kingdom was first head of department.
1988
First Physician Anaesthesiologists
The first graduates of the MakCHS Master in Medicine (MMed) in Anaesthesia program were Dr Tindimwebwa J.V.B and Dr Cephas Mijumbi graduated in 1988 with a
1985
Anaethetic Officer Program Created
Non physician anaesthesia provider training begain in teh 1960s at the Mulago School of anesthesia to provide on-the-job training for Medical Assistants. Multiple revisions of this program were formalized in 1971 and again in 1985 into the present day anaesthetic officer training program.
2000
Mbarara University Anaesthesia Opens
The anesthesia department at MUST was opened in 2000 with Dr. Stephen Ttendo being the first graduate and eventual head of department.
2014
AAU Established

##### Anesthetic assistant


- Training instituions
	- Mbale school of clinical officers
		- The Mbale School of Clinical Officers is a Government founded institution established in 1958. The School's minimum entry requirement is the Uganda Advanced Certificate of Education (UACE). (https://www.mak.ac.ug/affiliated-institutions/mbale-school-clinical-officers)	 

A few years ago it was decided to take suitable
candidates with ‘0’ levels straight from school.
These had a 3 year training in anaesthetics, the first
year being theory, the second year mixed theory and
practice and the third year entirely practical. The
products of this training are designated as ‘anaesthetic
assistants’. They can be of reasonable quality
but the scheme is likely to collapse unless an experienced
medical anaesthetist is found to run it.

Uganda Institute of Allied Health and Management Sciences - Mulago (UIAHMS) / Mugalo Paramedical school:
The School was started in 1929 with a laboratory training programme. This was in response to the Sleeping Sickness, Malaria, diarrhoea and Sexual Transmitted diseases epidemics of the time. The focus of the Colonial government was to be able to make correct diagnosis of diseases.
Other programmes started in a similar manner being started as a result of emerging Health needs. All of them started in the user departments. Over time the programmes become developed in size and scope and became organised into an Institution of learning (Uganda Institute of Allied Health and Management Sciences - Mulago (UIAHMS) ). Currently Uganda Institute of Allied Health and Management Sciences - Mulago (UIAHMS) is the largest Health Training Institution in the Country in terms of the number of students and range of programmes. The capacity of the Institution is 1500 students.

#### BscA

At Butesema
Encyclopedic

Uganda’s Health Sector Development Plan 2015-2020 has explicitly targeted increasing anaesthesia training capacity, yet existing training capacity for Ugandan anaesthesia providers (5 institutions) cannot meet current demands or match population growth. At the present rate, Uganda will not come close to achieving the 2030 anaesthesia workforce goals established by the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery and the World Health Organization
https://paperpile.com/app/p/eca38085-bf11-0145-9804-67b6b68f7f4d

AAU National Anaesthesia Workforce Strategy will achieve 2030 workforce goals to increase access to safe anaesthesia services

Admission criteria for the BScA are equivalent to those for the MBChB program. Mature entry diploma holders, current anaesthetic officers (higher diploma) and advanced level (UACE) school leavers are eligible for entry into the course. Students will spend the first two years learning basic sciences (MBChB) before completing two years of anaesthesia, critical care and pain management training. Graduates will hold a Bachelors Degree in Anaesthesia and will be known as Anaesthetic Officers (BScA). Any holder of the BScA will have an opportunity to further their career by joining medical school in the 3rd year of the MBChB programme (candidates may be required to complete mandatory clinical service after completing the BSc and before re-entering the MBChB program).

#### MD

 Albert Cook started training African Medical Assistants at Mulago during the First World War, and in the 1920s, encouraged the opening of a medical College that initially trained Africans to the level defined by the colonial government as “Asian sub-assistant surgeon”. The school grew to become a fully-fledged Medical School in his lifetime.

#### MMed

There are two 3-year MMed programmes in anaesthesia at present, one at Mulago Hospital Kampala, the other at Mbarara University Hospital. Apply after their intern year.

#### Other cadres



##### Registered comprehensive nurse

The Registered Comprehensive Nursing (RCN) and the Enrolled Comprehensive Nursing (ECN) training
programs started in Uganda in 1994 and 2003 respectively (Ministry of Education and Sports, 2004a; Ministry of
Education and Sports, 2006; Ministry of Health, 2010). These two new cadres of nurses were introduced into
Uganda’s Health care system to create a multi-purpose nurse with competencies in general nursing, midwifery,
public health, psychiatry, paediatrics and nursing management (Ministry of Education and Sports, 2004b; Ministry
of Education and Sports, 2006; United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA 2010). Upon graduation, these graduates
were expected to be deployed in primary health care outposts in rural areas of the country where they would provide
basic health services to the local communities (Ministry of Health, 2010). This paper reports about findings of a
study conducted to evaluate how the new cadre of nurses were introduced and how their curricula were
implemented. 
https://paperpile.com/app/p/26daf831-774b-0a25-ae16-ec555d6c613c


Many of the clinical training areas were also reported to be overcrowded, with inadequate learning facilities and
equipment, thus jeopardizing students learning, as this stakeholder expressed
https://paperpile.com/app/p/26daf831-774b-0a25-ae16-ec555d6c613c


With regard to the program duration, we noted that the curriculum was too ambitious for the time allotted and
lacked systematic external monitoring for quality. The amount of content to be covered far outweighed the capacity
of the students and the training institutions, including time within which to cover the content, as

	- comprehensive nurse 3792 trained 2007-2012
- diploma schools (3 years): 
	- ordinary diploma in nursing, 2194 trained
	- ordinary diploma in midwifery 1270 trained
	- diploma in comprehensive nursing 649
- diploma (BsN) from university where other things are taught as well (4 years, less if entered through above path)
	- 243 trained 2007-2012

Despite the establishment of Uganda Nurses and Midwives Council (UNMC) in 1956, the enactment of Uganda nurses and midwives act in 1960s and revised in 1966, the country has never had a nursing and midwifery policy, i.e. the mother board that should provide the strategic direction for the profession on most issues. As a result, Nursing and midwifery profession in the country is embroiled with a number of challenges ranging from outdated laws, unclear scope of practice, weak institutions, inequitable representation, weak leadership, all these affecting the quality of Nursing and Midwifery services.
