              educated doctors migrating from sub-Saharan African countries to
              Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States.
              DESIGN: Human capital cost analysis using publicly accessible
              data. SETTINGS: Sub-Saharan African countries. PARTICIPANTS: Nine
              sub-Saharan African countries with an HIV prevalence of 5\% or
              greater or with more than one million people with HIV/AIDS and
              with at least one medical school (Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi,
              Nigeria, South Africa, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe),
              and data available on the number of doctors practising in
              destination countries. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The financial cost
              of educating a doctor (through primary, secondary, and medical
              school), assuming that migration occurred after graduation, using
              current country specific interest rates for savings converted to
              US dollars; cost according to the number of source country
              doctors currently working in the destination countries; and
              savings to destination countries of receiving trained doctors.
              RESULTS: In the nine source countries the estimated government
              subsidised cost of a doctor's education ranged from \$21,000
              (\pounds{}{}13,000; €15,000) in Uganda to \$58,700 in South
              Africa. The overall estimated loss of returns from investment for
              all doctors currently working in the destination countries was
              \$2.17bn (95\% confidence interval 2.13bn to 2.21bn), with costs
              for each country ranging from \$2.16m (1.55m to 2.78m) for Malawi
              to \$1.41bn (1.38bn to 1.44bn) for South Africa. The ratio of the
              estimated compounded lost investment over gross domestic product
              showed that Zimbabwe and South Africa had the largest losses. The
              benefit to destination countries of recruiting trained doctors
              was largest for the United Kingdom (\$2.7bn) and United States
              (\$846m). CONCLUSIONS: Among sub-Saharan African countries most
              affected by HIV/AIDS, lost investment from the emigration of
              doctors is considerable. Destination countries should consider
              investing in measurable training for source countries and
              strengthening of their health systems.",

              and obstetrician workforce: thresholds and projections towards

  author   = "Holmer, Hampus and Shrime, Mark G and Riesel, Johanna N and
              Meara, John G and Hagander, Lars",
  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Billions of people are without access to surgical
              care, in part because of the inequitable distribution of the
              surgical workforce. Drawing on recently collected data for the
              number of surgeons, anaesthesiologists, and obstetricians
              worldwide, we sought to show their global maldistribution by
              identifying thresholds of surgical workforce densities, and by
              calculating the number of additional providers needed to reach
              those thresholds. METHODS: From the WHO Global Surgical Workforce
              Database, national data for the number of specialist surgeons,
              anaesthesiologists, and obstetricians per 100 000 population
              (density) were compared with the number of maternal deaths per
              100 000 live births (maternal mortality ratio; MMR) in WHO member
              countries. A regression line was fit between density of
              specialist surgeons, anaesthesiologists, and obstetricians and
              the logarithm of MMR, and we explored the correlation for an
              upper and a lower density threshold. Based on previous estimates
              of the global volume of surgical procedures, a global average
              productivity per specialist was derived. We then multiplied the
              average productivity with the derived upper and lower threshold
              densities, and compared these numbers to previously estimated
              global need of surgical procedures (4664 procedures per 100 000
              population). Finally, the numbers of additional providers needed
              to reach the thresholds in countries with a density below the
              respective threshold were calculated. FINDINGS: Each 10-unit
              increase in density of surgeons, anaesthesiologists, and
              obstetricians, corresponded to a 13·1\% decrease in MMR (95\% CI
              11·3-14·8). We saw particularly steep improvements in MMR from 0
              to roughly 20 per 100 000 population. Above roughly 40 per 100
              000 population, higher density was associated with relatively
              smaller improvements in MMR. These arbitrary thresholds of 20 and
              40 specialists per 100 000 corresponded with a volume of surgery
              of 2917 and 5834 procedures per 100 000 population, respectively,
              and were symmetrically distributed around the estimated global
              need of 4664 surgical procedures per 100 000 population. Our
              density thresholds are slightly higher than the current average
              in lower-middle income countries (16 per 100 000) and
              upper-middle-income countries (38 per 100 000), respectively. To
              reach the threshold of at least 20 per 100 000 in each country
              today, another 440 231 (IQR 438 900-443 245) providers would be
              needed. To reach 40 per 100 000, 1 110 610 (IQR 1 095 376-1 183
              525) providers would be needed. INTERPRETATION: Assuming uniform
              productivity, a global surgical workforce between 20 and 40 per
              100 000 would suffice to provide the world's missing surgical
              procedures. We concede that causality cannot be implied, but our
              results suggest that countries with a workforce density above
              certain thresholds have better health outcomes. Although the
              thresholds cannot be interpreted as a minimum standard, they are
              useful to characterise the global surgical workforce and its
              deficits. Such thresholds could also be used as markers for
              health system capacity. FUNDING: None.",
