Uganda’s Health Sector Development Plan 2015-2020 has explicitly targeted increasing anaesthesia training capacity, yet existing training capacity for Ugandan anaesthesia providers (5 institutions) cannot meet current demands or match population growth. At the present rate, Uganda will not come close to achieving the 2030 anaesthesia workforce goals established by the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery and the World Health Organization

Admission criteria for the BScA are equivalent to those for the MBChB program. Mature entry diploma holders, current anaesthetic officers (higher diploma) and advanced level (UACE) school leavers are eligible for entry into the course. Students will spend the first two years learning basic sciences (MBChB) before completing two years of anaesthesia, critical care and pain management training. Graduates will hold a Bachelors Degree in Anaesthesia and will be known as Anaesthetic Officers (BScA). Any holder of the BScA will have an opportunity to further their career by joining medical school in the 3rd year of the MBChB programme (candidates may be required to complete mandatory clinical service after completing the BSc and before re-entering the MBChB program).

#### Other cadres


##### Registered comprehensive nurse

The Registered Comprehensive Nursing (RCN) and the Enrolled Comprehensive Nursing (ECN) training
programs started in Uganda in 1994 and 2003 respectively (Ministry of Education and Sports, 2004a; Ministry of
Education and Sports, 2006; Ministry of Health, 2010). These two new cadres of nurses were introduced into
Uganda’s Health care system to create a multi-purpose nurse with competencies in general nursing, midwifery,
public health, psychiatry, paediatrics and nursing management (Ministry of Education and Sports, 2004b; Ministry
of Education and Sports, 2006; United Nations Population Fund, UNFPA 2010). Upon graduation, these graduates
were expected to be deployed in primary health care outposts in rural areas of the country where they would provide
basic health services to the local communities (Ministry of Health, 2010). This paper reports about findings of a
study conducted to evaluate how the new cadre of nurses were introduced and how their curricula were
implemented.

Many of the clinical training areas were also reported to be overcrowded, with inadequate learning facilities and
equipment, thus jeopardizing students learning, as this stakeholder expressed

With regard to the program duration, we noted that the curriculum was too ambitious for the time allotted and
lacked systematic external monitoring for quality. The amount of content to be covered far outweighed the capacity
of the students and the training institutions, including time within which to cover the content, as
