    "District-level information was obtained online, through the Ministry of Finance online \"Fiscal Transfers\" database <cite data-cite=\"otims_2018\"><a href=\"https://github.com/alexgoodell/uganda-model/blob/master/refs/cite-md/otims_2018.md\">(otims_2018)</a></cite>. Health facility information was obtained from the 2017 Health Facility Master List, which we found on the document-sharing website Scribd.com <cite data-cite=\"mohdhi2017\"><a href=\"https://github.com/alexgoodell/uganda-model/blob/master/refs/cite-md/mohdhi2017.md\">(mohdhi2017)</a></cite>. Data was extracted with the Tabula software. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Master facility list pre-processing\n",
    "After extraction, data from the master facility list were compared against summary tables from the same document to identify any missing data. Changes were needed in four districts:\n",
    "1. The Health Facility Master List claimed that there were 32 operating health facilities in the __Amuru__ district, but did not list any. For this district, 26 facilities were identified from the budgeting office data <cite data-cite=\"otims_2016\"><a href=\"https://github.com/alexgoodell/uganda-model/blob/master/refs/cite-md/otims_2016.md\">(otims_2016)</a></cite>. An additional three facilities (for a total of 29) were identified from 2012 health infastructure data: ST. AUGUSTINE Health Center II, Otwee Health Center III, and Pabbo Health Centre III <cite data-cite=\"hid2012\"><a href=\"https://github.com/alexgoodell/uganda-model/blob/master/refs/cite-md/hid2012.md\">(hid2012)</a></cite>. There were assigned a sub-county NHPI of SC8ZISZD6 (Amuru municipality)\n",
    "2. There were also no facilities listed for the __Kibaale__ district, though the document listed 16 facilities (7 of which are HCIII, 1 HC IV, 1 hospital) in a summary table (Table 8). This is a new district, created in July 2016, when the previous Kibaale District was split into Kagadi, Kakumiro and Kibaale. Eight facilities were identified in the budgeting data <cite data-cite=\"otims_2016\"><a href=\"https://github.com/alexgoodell/uganda-model/blob/master/refs/cite-md/otims_2016.md\">(otims_2016)</a></cite>, and two additional were identified with the infastructure data <cite data-cite=\"hid2012\"><a href=\"https://github.com/alexgoodell/uganda-model/blob/master/refs/cite-md/hid2012.md\">(hid2012)</a></cite>. This process thus identified a total of 5 HC III's, 1 HC IV, and 1 hospital. There were assigned a sub-country of SCLMS8IG1 (Kibaale town council).\n",
    "3. The __Mityana__ district was missing its 24th facility, reporting 65 of 66 facilities. According to table 5, this district has a hospital. After reviewing the budgeting data, Mityana Hospital was identified and added to our database. It was assigned a random sub-county within Mityana: SC96Q5BX1 (Bulera Subcounty)\n",
    "4. Three facilites in the __Mukono__ district (68: Royal Family Clinic Clinic, 88:\tTrinity Clinic Clinic, 91: Vine Medical centre Clinic) did not have a sub-county NHPI. These facilities were assigned a sub-county NHPI of SCTMPU7S6 (for the Mukono Municipality).\n",
