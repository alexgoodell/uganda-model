    "%To deal with the high demand for medical services in Uganda the post of a separate healthcare provider, termed a Medical Assistant, was developed in the 1960s. The title was officially changed to that of Clinical Officer (CO) in 1996. The qualification required to practise as a CO involves three years of training at specialist schools. The clinical work of COs initially comprised the diagnosis and treatment of patients in primary healthcare. The role has however expanded and today COs are also an integral part of district and regional hospitals. In the rural setting COs are responsible for the assessment, management and, where necessary, safe transfer of the surgical patient. In addition to their clinical work, COs are also often responsible for the administrative duties of their respective HCs. At the better-equipped Health Centres and District hospitals they undertake minor surgical procedures themselves and assist in more complex operations5.\n",

This is a pilot centre for students from the Northern Region who wish to study Anaesthesia. We have so far trained 24 Anaesthetic Officers and 58 Anaesthetic Assistants providing anaesthetic services in government and non- government institutions in Uganda.
